CocosTools
==========

This project open sources some of the bits used in the Pocket Boy application. Such tools were also made possible thanks to the help of many other coders who shared their work before me. Thank you!
This tools project grew to include other open source and BSD-style licensed projects which were useful to me when developing Pocket Boy and that I am using now in other Cocos2D based applicartions. I do my best to stay up to date with each project to make sure you won't miss any new feature or bug fix from them. In some cases, I am using a fork for the projects in which I am slightly ahead of some commits, but they are going to be noted and a pull request for those changes has already been submitted.

There are some utilities dealing with Physics Management (a World Physics singleton and a related Fixed Time Step loop implementation), Music Management (for music tracks and sound effects, even though it is just a tiny layer for now), custom CCSprite subclasses, a slightly enhanced CCMenuAdvanced implementation (adds a position to quickly get the on screen position of a CCMenuItem in horizontal and vertical single row/column menus), etc...

This library is meant to be used alongside the following projects:

CocosLib: https://github.com/Panajev/CocosLib

Utilities: https://github.com/Panajev/Utilities
