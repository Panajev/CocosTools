This project open sources some of the bits used in the Pocket Boy application. Such tools were also made possible thanks to the help of many other coders who shared their work before me. Thank you!

There are some utilities dealing with Physics Management (a World Physics singleton and a related Fixed Time Step loop implementation), Music Management (for music tracks and sound effects, even though it is just a tiny layer for now), custom CCSprite subclasses, a slightly enhanced CCMenuAdvanced implementation (adds a position to quickly get the on screen position of a CCMenuItem in horizontal and vertical single row/column menus), etc...

This library is meant to be used alongside the following projects:

CocosLib: https://github.com/Panajev/CocosLib

Utilities: https://github.com/Panajev/Utilities

FacebookLib: https://github.com/Panajev/FacebookLib
